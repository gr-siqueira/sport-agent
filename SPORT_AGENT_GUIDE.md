**Use Cases:**

- (Future) Sends it via email/SMS

**How It Works:**

2. System schedules a daily job for that time
3. Every day at 7:00 AM, your digest is generated

## Managing Your Preferences

### Updating Your Preferences

1. **Via Web UI:**
   - Open http://localhost:8000
   - Your current preferences will be pre-filled
   - Modify any fields
   - Click "Save Preferences"
   - System will reschedule your daily digest

2. **Via API:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/preferences/YOUR_USER_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "teams": ["Lakers", "Celtics"],
    "players": ["LeBron James"],
    "leagues": ["NBA"],
    "delivery_time": "08:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }'
```

### Viewing Your Preferences

**Via API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/preferences/YOUR_USER_ID
```

### Viewing Digest History

Access your last 30 digests:

**Via API:**
```bash

```

Returns JSON with digest content and timestamps.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No digest generated

**Possible Causes:**
1. Server not running continuously
2. Scheduling error

**Solutions:**
- Ensure server is running 24/7 for automated digests
- Check server logs for errors
- Try generating digest manually first

### Problem: Game times are wrong

**Possible Causes:**
1. Incorrect timezone setting

**Solutions:**
- Update your timezone in preferences
- Verify timezone matches your location
- Supported timezones listed in dropdown

### Problem: Missing some teams

**Possible Causes:**
1. Team name not recognized
2. Typo in team name

**Solutions:**
- Use commonly recognized names (e.g., "Lakers" not "L.A. Lakers")
- Check for typos in your teams list
- Try variations (e.g., "Man United" or "Manchester United")

### Problem: Digest seems generic

**Possible Causes:**
1. Using LLM fallback (no real sports APIs)
2. Limited team/player information

**Solutions:**
- This is expected for MVP (uses AI to generate realistic content)
- Future versions will integrate real sports APIs
- Add more specific players to follow for better personalization

### Problem: Can't find my user ID

**Solutions:**
- Check browser localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('sport_agent_user_id')`
- User ID is returned when you first save preferences
- Look in browser console after saving preferences

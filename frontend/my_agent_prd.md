# Sport Agent - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
**Sport Agent** is an intelligent AI-powered system that delivers personalized daily sports digests. Users configure their interests (teams, players, tournaments) once, and receive curated morning briefings with upcoming games, recent scores, player news, and matchup analysis—all tailored to what they care about.

## Problem Statement
Sports fans follow multiple teams, players, and leagues across different sports, making it time-consuming to stay updated. Current solutions require:
- Checking multiple apps/websites daily
- Sifting through irrelevant content
- Missing important games or news about favorite teams

### Core Technologies

**From Trip Planner Architecture**:
- **LangGraph 0.2.55+**: Multi-agent orchestration with parallel execution
- **LangChain 0.3.7+**: Agent framework and tool instrumentation
- **FastAPI**: REST API endpoints
- **OpenAI GPT-4/3.5**: LLM for agent intelligence
- **Arize OTEL**: Observability and tracing

**New Additions**:
- **Sports APIs**:
  - ESPN API (free tier: schedule, scores)
  - SportsDataIO API (comprehensive stats)
  - The Odds API (betting lines, predictions)
- **Scheduling**: Celery/APScheduler for daily digest generation
- **Notification**: Email (SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), or Push notifications
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for user preferences and digest history

### Data Flow

1. **User Onboarding** (POST `/configure-interests`):
   ```json
   {
     "teams": ["Los Angeles Lakers", "Manchester United"],
     "players": ["LeBron James", "Bruno Fernandes"],
     "leagues": ["NBA", "Premier League"],
     "delivery_time": "07:00",
     "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
     "notification_method": "email"
   }
   ```

2. **Daily Digest Generation** (Scheduled Cron Job):
   - Trigger at user's preferred time
   - Invoke LangGraph workflow with user preferences
   - Parallel agent execution (Schedule, Scores, Player)
   - Digest agent synthesizes results
   - Deliver via configured method

3. **Manual Digest Request** (POST `/generate-digest`):
   - On-demand generation for user
   - Same workflow as scheduled generation

### Graceful Degradation Pattern
Following Trip Planner's pattern, all tools implement fallbacks:
1. Try real sports API (ESPN, SportsData)
2. Fall back to web scraping if API unavailable
3. Fall back to LLM knowledge if scraping fails
4. Always return useful information, never fail completely

### RAG Implementation
- **Database**: Player statistics, team histories, rivalry information
- **Vector Store**: In-memory or Pinecone for production
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- **Retrieval**: Top-3 relevant context for player/team queries

## Appendix: Code Adaptation from Trip Planner

### State Definition (TypedDict)
```python
class SportDigestState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    user_preferences: Dict[str, Any]  # teams, players, leagues
    schedule: Optional[str]            # Schedule agent output
    scores: Optional[str]              # Scores agent output
    player_news: Optional[str]         # Player agent output
    final_digest: Optional[str]        # Digest agent output
    tool_calls: Annotated[List[Dict[str, Any]], operator.add]
```

### Parallel Graph Execution
```python
def build_graph():
    g = StateGraph(SportDigestState)
    g.add_node("schedule_node", schedule_agent)
    g.add_node("scores_node", scores_agent)
    g.add_node("player_node", player_agent)
    g.add_node("digest_node", digest_agent)

    # Run schedule, scores, and player agents in parallel
    g.add_edge(START, "schedule_node")
    g.add_edge(START, "scores_node")
    g.add_edge(START, "player_node")
    
    # All three feed into digest agent
    g.add_edge("schedule_node", "digest_node")
    g.add_edge("scores_node", "digest_node")
    g.add_edge("player_node", "digest_node")
    
    g.add_edge("digest_node", END)

    return g.compile()  # No checkpointing for parallel execution
```

### Tool Example with Graceful Degradation
```python
@tool
def upcoming_games(teams: List[str], date: str = "today") -> str:
    """Get upcoming games for specified teams."""
    query = f"upcoming games schedule for {', '.join(teams)} on {date}"
    
    # Try ESPN API
    games_data = _espn_api(teams, date)
    if games_data:
        return _format_schedule(games_data)
    
    # Try SportsData API
    games_data = _sportsdata_api(teams, date)
    if games_data:
        return _format_schedule(games_data)
    
    # LLM fallback
    instruction = f"List upcoming games for {', '.join(teams)} on {date} with times."
    return _llm_fallback(instruction)
```
